<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hello! I’m Tugba Yalvac Mohammed — a passionate junior web developer currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications. I specialize in full-stack web development with a growing focus on real-world, user-centered projects. With hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, I enjoy turning ideas into functional, clean, and responsive applications.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I recently completed a 10-week internship where I built a complete vehicle service booking system from scratch, implementing role-based dashboards, appointment management, and real-time notifications. I also explore robotics in my free time, working with Arduino, sensors, and circuit prototyping — blending hardware with software to solve real problems creatively.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I’m a curious learner, a problem solver at heart, and someone who believes that consistency and self-belief can take you far. I’m actively building my skills and portfolio, and I look forward to contributing to meaningful projects as I grow in this exciting field.</p>
